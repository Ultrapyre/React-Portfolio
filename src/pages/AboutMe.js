                    <p>Name: Sidney Mak</p>
                    <p>Country of Origin: Hong Kong</p>

                    <p>Hi! Seeing as I'm bad with formalities, I can talk a little bit about myself right here.</p>
                    <p>I hail from Hong Kong, currently living in Perth. As part of my efforts to secure a foothold here, I have been taking lessons in web design, and this little website here is to showcase my current skillset!</p>
                    <p>It's not all that much to look at for now, but it'll be much more impressive in the future! Hopefully.</p>
